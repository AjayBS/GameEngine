1. I have implemented a basic game of Pong 
2. The left paddle can be controlled by keys W and S
3. The right paddle can be controlled by keys I and K
4. The game ends when one of the players misses the ball 3 times.
5. I have implemented simple reflection for collision response which made me feel pretty good.
